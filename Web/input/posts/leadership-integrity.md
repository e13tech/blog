Title: Leadership Traits - Integrity - The Quiet Backbone of Leadership
Lead: Integrity is one of the most important traits of a great leader, but it's not always easy to maintain, especially when it’s tested in real-world situations. In Simon Sinek's video Top 3 Leadership Traits, he highlights how closely integrity and courage are connected. In my own experience, I’ve found that standing by your values sometimes takes just as much courage as any bold decision. I was recently reminded of this when I had to balance my integrity as a leader with the realities of client relationships in the consulting world.

In Simon Sinek's *Top 3 Leadership Traits*, the second trait he highlights is integrity. It’s a close cousin to courage because, in my experience, it often takes courage to maintain your integrity, especially in challenging situations. Integrity isn't just about doing what’s right when it’s easy; it’s about staying true to your values and ethics when the stakes are high, even if it comes at a personal or professional cost.

I was reminded of this on a project a while back when one of my colleagues faced unprofessional behavior from a client. The client made comments like “Have you been paying attention?” and “What’s wrong with you?”—things that felt very out of line. The situation had an unfortunate, but all too familiar, undertone: the kind you see when a woman in a predominantly male environment gets treated differently. While I hope that wasn’t the case, you can't fault me for making that connection, given the difference in how she was treated versus how I had been treated by the same client.

### Integrity and Ethics

When you talk about integrity, you also have to talk about ethics. And to me, this was not ethical treatment of anyone on my team. My first instinct was to push back hard against the client because that type of behavior was unacceptable in my book. But, as anyone in the consulting world knows, it’s not that simple. You can’t just burn bridges. Consulting requires a careful balance between standing up for what’s right and preserving the client relationship. As terrible as it is, we’re often forced to temper our responses, defaulting to things like, “Maybe they just had a bad day,” or “Maybe you’re reading too much into it.”

This brings me to a quote I recently came across on Instagram: ["Integrity is not something you show others. It is how you behave behind their back."](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8iJag3PEw3/embedd) Integrity is not something you need to overtly advertise; it becomes apparent through your actions, even when nobody is watching. That really resonated with me because, in leadership, it’s often the decisions we make behind the scenes that speak the loudest about our character.

### Cooler Heads Prevail

In this case, we took a step back. Behind the scenes, cooler heads relayed to the client that, if this really happened, it was unacceptable. And while my gut reaction that day was to push back hard, in the end, I’m glad we didn’t go with that. Why? Because that same team member went on to stay with the client, working happily with them for over a year. She became such a valued contributor that they relied on her long after the rest of the team had rolled off the project.

### Integrity Meets Courage

A good leader needs integrity—not just to stand up for their team, but to balance that with the courage to make decisions that are right for the business. If the client’s behavior had continued, we would have “fired” them, no question. But that wouldn’t have been an easy decision, nor should it have been. If we had gone with my initial reaction that day, she might have lost out on what turned out to be a hugely valuable professional experience. In the consulting world, successfully navigating a project with a client for over a year is no small feat. 

Integrity isn’t always about immediate action or standing up in a moment of conflict. Sometimes it’s about having the patience and wisdom to let things play out, to see if a cooler, more diplomatic approach can lead to a better outcome for everyone involved.
