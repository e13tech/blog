Title: Velocity as a Team Metric, Not an Individual One
Lead: When working in Agile, velocity is often used as a key indicator of progress. But it's essential to remember that velocity is a team metric, not an individual one. Too often, teams fall into the trap of judging individual performance based on the number of story points completed in a sprint. This approach can lead to misaligned expectations, incentivize the wrong behavior, and ultimately weaken the team dynamic. In this post, I'll explore why velocity should be viewed through the lens of team collaboration, how to avoid common pitfalls in measuring individual contributions, and why focusing on team output is crucial for long-term success.

In Agile development, velocity is one of the most commonly tracked metrics, but it's important to recognize that **velocity should always be viewed as a team metric, not an individual one**. Measuring individual contributions by the number of story points they complete in a sprint can lead to misunderstandings, broken team dynamics, and even incentivizing the wrong behavior.

### Supporting the Team, Not Just Individual Output

Just because one team member consistently completes fewer points within a sprint than others doesn't mean they are underperforming. In fact, they may be supporting other members of the team in ways that enable the team as a whole to complete more work. For example, senior developers often take on mentoring roles or help to unblock others. While their individual point contribution may appear lower, their support allows others to work more efficiently, ultimately boosting the **team's overall velocity**.

**Does this mean we should ignore an individual's velocity? Of course not!** For starters, it helps a scrummaster or team lead determine how much work that individual should pick up from sprint to sprint. It's also a great **conversation starter** for their manager during performance reviews. Ideally, if someone's velocity is low, it's because the rest of the team is ecstatic to have them around to support and accelerate the team's performance. And if they are happy with that role, it might even indicate that they are ready to lead their own team, should they want to pursue that direction. There are plenty of good reasons for lower individual velocities, and it's important to explore and understand them to ensure that the team is benefiting as a whole.

### Avoiding the Incentive Trap

There's a trap that many teams and managers fall into: the assumption that senior developers should produce significantly more story points than junior developers. While it might seem logical, it incentivizes the wrong behavior. If senior developers focus only on maximizing their own output, they lose the opportunity to mentor and assist junior team members, which could result in fewer overall story points for the team.

In my experience, it's more productive to focus on how senior developers can elevate the team as a whole. By encouraging collaboration and supporting the growth of less experienced developers, senior team members play a critical role in improving the team's velocity over the long term. Agile is all about **the team** working together to deliver value-not about individual heroics.

### Communicating About Team Velocity

Of course, as a manager, you should still watch out for individuals who may be underperforming. But before jumping to conclusions based on point totals alone, it's crucial to communicate with the team to understand the context. I've found that when a team is functioning well, the best contributors will highlight how integral their peers are to the team's success, even if their point totals appear lower. This reinforces the idea that velocity is truly a **team effort**.

For a deeper dive into how story points can support healthy team velocity, check out my [previous post on Agile story points](/posts/agile-story-points), where I explore how aligning story points and communication can prevent confusion and frustration among teams and stakeholders alike.

### Conclusion

Velocity, when used properly, is a powerful tool to measure the **team's progress**. But we have to remember that the metric is about the team's output, not individual performance. The more we focus on collaboration and support within the team, the higher the velocity will rise in the long term.
