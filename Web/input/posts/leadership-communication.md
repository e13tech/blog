Title: Leadership Traits - Communication - The Underrated Leadership Trait
Lead: Communication is often seen as a basic skill, but in leadership, it’s one of the most vital—and underrated—traits. It’s not just about keeping your team informed; it’s about ensuring the right people, both inside and outside your team, know what’s happening at the right time. In my experience, clear and thoughtful communication can make or break a project, especially in consulting where so many external factors are at play. Let’s dive into why communication is more than just passing information—it's an art that can define your success as a leader.

Communication is often cited as a critical leadership skill, but in practice, it can be one of the most underrated traits. It’s easy to assume that people will know what’s going on or that things will just "work out," but time and time again, I’ve seen how crucial communication is for success—both within a team and with the stakeholders and teams around you.

Within your team, clear communication is essential for alignment and collaboration. Your team needs to know where they’re heading, what the expectations are, and what obstacles they may face. Without that clarity, the chance of misalignment grows, and so does the risk of failure. Whether it’s daily standups, quick updates, or sharing decisions and reasoning behind them, you can’t underestimate how much communication impacts a team’s ability to succeed.

But as important as internal communication is, it’s equally important to communicate beyond your team. Rarely does any team, especially in consulting, operate in isolation. We’re almost always relying on other teams or stakeholders—whether it's business leaders giving requirements that shape the software, infrastructure and admin teams laying the foundation, or other technical teams providing support. How many times have you heard complaints like, “We really wish we had better communication with team X,” or, “Upper management was upset because they had no idea what was happening on our side”?

### Balancing Transparency and Trust

In consulting, you sometimes need to be very careful with how transparent you are. While I always prefer to be more transparent, I’ve found that some people may overreact to certain details you share. Communication is not just about *relaying information*—it’s about *how* that information is relayed.

Here’s an example from one of my first large agile projects: I had two teams, one highly familiar with the solution, building out key enhancements, and another team new to both the client and the solution. In an attempt to be transparent, I shared the velocity figures for both teams. Unfortunately, the stakeholders, who were new to agile and not the most understanding clients I’ve worked with, saw the numbers and jumped to the conclusion that the newer team was failing. Based on just two weeks of data in what was to be a ten-month engagement, they believed the project was doomed to fail.

Clearly, I shared too much. I wanted to be transparent, but that level of granularity only confused the client. By the next week, I drastically refined my communication, limiting the details I shared while focusing on progress. I did get some pushback—some stakeholders felt I was "hiding details"—but I explained that my goal was to show the most important information and that they were welcome to dig into day-to-day activities if they wanted, though I cautioned it might just waste their time due to the solution's complexity.

Thankfully, the key stakeholders gave me the benefit of the doubt, and the project ultimately became one of the most successful in my history. It was a massive project—estimated at over $1 million, with 40+ team members across three development tracks. Not only did we deliver ahead of schedule by a week, but we also added scope that provided even more value to the users than originally planned. By any definition, it was a great success, but the key to getting there was refining how I communicated.

### The Two Sides of Communication: Speaking and Listening

When we talk about communication, we often think about sharing information, but there’s another side that’s just as critical—listening. It’s not enough to simply inform others of what your team is doing; you also need to ensure that others feel heard. This could mean making space for questions from stakeholders, checking in with supporting teams, or understanding the feedback your own team members are giving. Strong communication isn’t just about telling; it’s about facilitating an open dialogue where everyone feels they have a voice.

If stakeholders don’t feel heard, or if their feedback comes too late in the process, it can cause frustration or derail a project. If other teams you rely on aren’t kept in the loop, it can lead to delays and inefficiencies. Good communication helps build trust and prevents those unwanted surprises that can throw off an otherwise well-executed project.

### Transparent Communication Leads to Success

Ultimately, a good leader ensures that communication is a two-way street. You need to speak up for your team, ensure everyone knows what’s happening, and listen carefully to others. Without communication, even the best-laid plans can unravel.

In the consulting world, where so many factors are at play, good communication can make or break a project. It’s about being clear, transparent, and open—both inside your team and with everyone who impacts your work. And it’s about doing so with care, understanding how much information to share and when to share it, so that your stakeholders trust the picture you’re painting without being overwhelmed.
