# The Power of Feedback: Why Waiting Isn't an Option
In the fast-paced world of consulting and project management, feedback isn't just a nicety-it's a necessity. I recently watched a compelling video titled Feedback is a Gift, which underscored several crucial aspects of feedback that resonated deeply with me. It reminded me that while we all acknowledge the importance of feedback, proactively seeking it out can make all the difference between success and stagnation.

The Value of Proactively Soliciting Feedback
Waiting for feedback is like sailing without a compass; you might be moving, but you have no idea if you're headed in the right direction. In times of stress or uncertainty, it's especially vital to reach out to peers you respect and ask for their insights. None of us are immune to snapping under pressure-we're human, after all. What sets effective leaders apart is how they respond in these moments. By actively seeking feedback, we can course-correct before minor issues escalate into major problems.

Proactive feedback solicitation aligns seamlessly with Agile principles, particularly the emphasis on continuous improvement. Agile thrives on regular check-ins and adjustments, ensuring that teams remain aligned with goals and can adapt swiftly to changes.

## A Personal Experience with Feedback
I recall being brought into a project that wasn't going as well as the stakeholders had hoped. Deadlines had been missed multiple times, and there was immense pressure on me to bring the project to a swift closure. My primary focus became just that: closing things out quickly to meet the demands from above.

In this rush, I did solicit feedback from the team-but in hindsight, I clearly didn't do enough. My attempts were surface-level, perhaps a quick check-in here or a brief meeting there. I was so consumed with meeting the tight deadlines that I neglected to create a space where team members felt truly heard or valued.

One day, during a particularly stressful meeting, a team member snapped at me. While his reaction was unprofessional, it was a stark indicator of deeper issues. He felt unheard, overworked, and undervalued. This was a pivotal moment for me. I realized that in my narrow focus on closing the project, I was repeating the same mistakes that others had made, which had contributed to the project's current state-I was overlooking the team's morale and the importance of genuine communication.

Recognizing this, I decided to shift my approach. I arranged one-on-one meetings with each team member, setting aside the urgency of deadlines for a moment to genuinely listen. I asked open-ended questions about their concerns, obstacles they were facing, and suggestions they might have for improving our process.

The insights I gained were eye-opening. Team members shared that they felt the timelines were unrealistic, resources were stretched thin, and expectations were unclear. They also expressed a desire for more involvement in decision-making processes. By addressing these concerns-adjusting timelines where feasible, clarifying objectives, and involving the team more collaboratively-we began to see a positive shift. Morale improved, communication barriers broke down, and progress toward project completion accelerated.

This experience taught me that simply checking the box of "soliciting feedback" isn't sufficient. Genuine feedback requires time, openness, and a willingness to act on what you learn. Effective leadership isn't just about meeting deadlines; it's about fostering an environment where open dialogue is encouraged, and team members feel their voices matter.

## Seeking Feedback in Good Times
It's easy to overlook feedback when things are going well. After all, if it isn't broken, why fix it? However, I believe that the best time to seek feedback is precisely when the sails are full and the seas are calm. By asking, "What can I do better?" we uncover opportunities for refinement that might be harder to address during turbulent times. It's not about seeking a pat on the back-though positive reinforcement is always welcome-but about striving for excellence even when good seems good enough.

## Feedback and Agile Methodology: A Perfect Match
In consulting, there's no such thing as a "perfect project." Ups and downs are part of the journey. Agile methodology embraces this reality by promoting continuous feedback loops. One of the reasons I'm a proponent of Agile is its emphasis on "failing fast." By iterating in short cycles-typically two weeks-we can identify failures or misalignments early on, assess them, and adjust our approach accordingly.

Consider the alternative: working for six months under the assumption that everything is on track, only to discover that key stakeholders are dissatisfied. Not only is this demoralizing, but it also requires significantly more effort to rectify issues that have been festering unnoticed.

## Bridging the Perception Gap

Another insightful video that delves into effective feedback is a talk by cognitive psychologist LeeAnn Renninger. She shares a scientifically proven method for giving feedback that is both honest and constructive. One of her key points is the importance of not waiting for feedback to come to you but actively seeking it out.

Sometimes, despite our best efforts, there's a gap between how we perceive our performance and how others perceive it. High performers might assume that no news is good news, but that's not always the case. Misalignments can occur due to a lack of transparency, insufficient communication, or differing expectations.

By proactively soliciting feedback, we can uncover hidden concerns or misunderstandings. Perhaps a stakeholder feels out of the loop, or maybe there's a misalignment in expectations. Addressing these issues early not only prevents future conflicts but also demonstrates a commitment to transparency and continuous improvement.

LeeAnn Renninger emphasizes a structured approach to feedback that includes clear observations, the impact of the behavior, and open-ended questions to foster dialogue. This method ensures that feedback is not only heard but also understood and acted upon.

## Conclusion

Feedback is indeed a gift-one that we should not wait to receive passively. By actively seeking feedback, especially during both challenging and prosperous times, we position ourselves and our teams for sustained success. It fosters a culture of openness, reduces the risk of misunderstandings, and aligns us more closely with our goals.

Moreover, I highly recommend watching LeeAnn Renninger's talk in full. It offers more valuable insights into the science of giving and receiving effective feedback than I could cover here.
