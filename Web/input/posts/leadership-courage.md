Title: Leadership Traits - Courage - Do I have It?
Lead: Leadership is often tied to boldness and courage, but what does that really mean in the context of project teams and software development? In Top 3 Leadership Traits, Simon Sinek highlights courage as a key quality for leaders. It made me wonder-do I have courage? I've been called a great leader, but I've never thought of myself as particularly courageous. Yet, when I reflect, I realize courage isn't always about bold gestures. Sometimes, it's about having tough conversations and standing up for your team when it matters most.

Simon says courage is a key trait of a leader-do I agree? Absolutely. It's the ability to step into uncertainty, make tough decisions, and stand up for what's right, even when it's uncomfortable or unpopular. And yet, when I think about myself as a leader, I've never really considered myself to be particularly courageous.

Sure, I've had people tell me that they see me as a great leader, but does that mean I have courage? I'm not sure I would describe myself that way. In fact, I tend to think of courage in a much more heroic sense-people who take on life-threatening challenges or advocate for massive social change. So where does that leave me, someone who leads project teams and software solutions? Do I really have courage?

### Courage in the Everyday

As Simon explains, courage isn't always about grand gestures or dramatic risks. It's about stepping up when it matters most, especially in moments that challenge our comfort zones. And when I think about it that way, maybe I've had more of those moments than I initially realized. You don't have to think of yourself as courageous-if you try to be the best leader you can for your team, I believe that will come naturally.

In my role as a software solution architect, I'm not often called upon to take physical risks, but I am called upon to do something that feels just as daunting-have the hard conversations, say what needs to be said, and advocate for my team, even when it's not the most popular opinion in the room.

For instance, there have been times when I've had to stand firm and push back against unrealistic project timelines. There have been meetings where I've had to tell stakeholders that the direction they want to go isn't feasible, even though it wasn't what they wanted to hear. And these moments require courage-not the kind that's flashy or makes headlines, but the kind that ensures my team has the best chance of success.

### Standing Up for the Team

If there's one area where I feel my courage shows up the most, it's in standing up for my team. I've always believed that part of my job as a leader is to ensure my team is positioned to succeed. That means I have to be willing to challenge decisions that don't align with that goal, even when it's uncomfortable or unpopular. It's about having the courage to protect my team from burnout by pushing back when expectations are too high or timelines are too short.

I've written before about the importance of defending your team when the stakes are high and the pressure is on. In my post [Leadership: Defending Your Team](xref:leadership-defending-your-team), I explored the delicate balance of advocacy-knowing when to step in to protect your team's well-being and when to let them rise to the challenge. You don't have to think of yourself as courageous to do this-if you're focused on leading your team the best you can, courage will come naturally. Standing up in those moments, even when it's uncomfortable, ensures that your team has the best possible environment to succeed.

As Simon points out, courage is often about doing what's right, even when it's hard. And in my experience, that's the core of leadership-making the tough calls that set your team up for success, even if it ruffles some feathers along the way.

### Quiet Acts of Courage

I used to think that courage had to be bold and noticeable, but over time, I've come to see it differently. As Simon says, real courage often happens behind the scenes, in the quieter moments when you choose to take a stand because it's what's best for your people and your project. You don't have to think of yourself as courageous-just focus on being the best leader for your team, and that courage will follow.

So maybe I do have courage, after all-just not in the way I originally thought. It's not about being fearless; it's about being willing to face the fear and the discomfort because you know it's the right thing to do.
