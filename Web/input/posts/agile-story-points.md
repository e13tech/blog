Title: Story Points - A Tool to Solve Problems, Not a Metric
Lead: In Agile development, story points are one of the most valuable tools we use to estimate work, but like any tool, their effectiveness depends on how well they are used and understood. Story points help teams plan and communicate around complexity, capacity, and risk. However, without clear communication and alignment-especially across multiple teams-they can easily lead to confusion, misinterpretation, and even frustration, particularly for stakeholders focused on schedules and budgets. In this post, I'll share my thoughts on the best ways to use story points, the importance of viewing velocity as a team metric, and how to avoid common pitfalls when communicating story points to both teams and stakeholders.

Recently, I came across a thought-provoking post on LinkedIn discussing the use of story points in Agile and their potential pitfalls. The post raised some excellent points about how story points can become misunderstood or misused if teams or stakeholders don't align on their purpose. This topic really resonated with me because, in my experience, the power of story points lies in how they are communicated and understood-especially when multiple teams are involved.

### The Challenge with Multiple Teams

One of the most common issues I've faced when using story points across multiple teams is the inconsistency in how stories are sized. Even when teams follow the same estimation practices, their interpretation of story points can vary greatly. Differences in experience, familiarity with the codebase, and the nature of the work can all influence how teams size their stories.

If comparing velocities between teams is important, then it's crucial to have **reference stories**-stories that both teams can use as a baseline to align their estimates. Without this alignment, comparing velocities becomes like comparing apples to oranges. This becomes even more significant when communicating with stakeholders who are less interested in the mechanics of Agile and more focused on **impact to schedule and budget**. They often see velocity as a simple measurement of progress, so any discrepancies between teams can raise red flags, even if there's a valid reason for the difference.

### Communication Around Story Points

Communication around story points is where I've learned some of my most valuable lessons. In a previous project, I made the mistake of not fully explaining to the business why two teams had "different velocities," despite the fact that both participated in joint story pointing sessions to align on sizes.

The business interpreted the differing velocities as one team being more efficient than the other, which wasn't the case. The teams were working on different types of tasks, with varying levels of complexity and risk, and had different levels of experience with the codebase. These factors weren't fully communicated, and the result was confusion and concern from stakeholders about the project's overall progress.

This experience taught me a crucial lesson: while aligning story points within teams is important, **communicating** why velocities differ is even more critical. Failing to fully explain these nuances can lead to story points doing more harm than good. When misunderstood, story points stop being helpful estimation tools and start becoming misleading metrics. This is why effective communication, not just within the team but with stakeholders, is key to ensuring that story points serve their intended purpose.

### My Experience with Agile Story Points

Reflecting on my past experiences, I've seen firsthand the benefits and challenges of using story points as an estimation tool. When used correctly, story points help teams forecast their capacity and better understand the scope of their work. However, when miscommunicated or misunderstood, they can lead to frustration, especially from stakeholders who don't live in the Agile world.

I've also found that story points need to remain flexible. Different teams will always approach work differently, and factors like technical debt, knowledge of the domain, and even team morale can impact how stories are sized and how quickly teams move through their work. This flexibility needs to be communicated openly to stakeholders to avoid misunderstandings. Story points are not a metric; they are a **conversation starter**-a way to open discussions about complexity, risk, and capacity, not a rigid measure of output.


### Conclusion

In response to the LinkedIn post, I want to emphasize that story points are an invaluable tool when used correctly. I strongly recommend using them, as they help teams have meaningful conversations about complexity, risk, and capacity. However, it's important to remember the problem they are meant to solve-aligning the team's understanding of the work, not serving as a precise metric of progress.

If we lose sight of this, story points can become counterproductive, leading to confusion or misalignment. When used with clarity and purpose, they are one of the most effective tools for helping Agile teams manage their work and communicate progress to stakeholders.
