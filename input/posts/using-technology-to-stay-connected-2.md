Title: Using Technology to stay connected
Lead: This truly is an unprecidented time in our lifetime, but instead of looking at how long the road is before us I'm looking at how technology is allowing us to live our lives in spite of the restrictions upon us.

I've been working to restart a blog presence this year so have been researching and collecting material to kick off some fun tech focused series.  My style of writing I like to consider more laid back, light-hearted, and all-in-all *fun*, I'm a technology enthusiast and have yet to meet a tech that I didn't find at least somewhat interesting and I want to enjoy the tech as share that enjoyment with others.  Then [COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) happened, which I think everyone can agree is an unprecedented event for our lifetimes.  I am remaining optimistic that this will not be as bad as we are preparing for but obviously this is serious and scary stuff not to be taken lightly; however I also want to try to keep a focus on positive content to offset many of the scary uncertain material that has been top of mind of late.  To that end I've been watching how companies are able to respond to this situation and in particular how technology has enabled some to transition to virtual work and it is fascinating to me to see how technology is enabling us to transition to a more WFH (Work From Home) virtual heavy collaboration environment.  If you can look past the negative and struggles as the world adapts it really is fascinating.

Most of my clients are allowing WFH (Work From Home) and some have been able to successfully transition / scale to this model seamlessly but some struggle or have reservations about if their infrastructure can support such a large user base hitting their systems virtually at the same time because "we've never needed to try this before".  A very understandable and justified concern to have clearly. For most of them they have already made all the right investments in the right technologies to scale and meet these demands head but for those who may be struggling I thought it'd be fun to "geek out" over some of the types of technologies (some high level platforms, some lower level resources) and how they can help companies cope with this situation.

One of the key factors to success in my opinion is properly embracing the cloud. One of the promises of the cloud (be it [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) which is my specialty, or [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/), or any of the smaller ones) the ability to elastically scale on demand; and having all of your workforce suddenly being full time remote is a perfect reference case.  When most people talk about "the cloud" they are typically referring to one of these public clouds, but there are also hybrid clouds where companies can leverage on-prem server infrastructure along side a public cloud or even have their own private cloud.  As silly and borderline impractical as it may be IMO there are even articles about using a farm of [Raspberry Pi's](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) to host your own [private cloud](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3532310/raspberry-pi-is-your-new-private-cloud.html).  But lets focus on more real world business cases, here are a couple of my favorite techs in the Azure Cloud that I believe are helping companies adapt to the sudden virtual workplace demand.

![AppService](/images/posts/AppServicesLogo.png "AppService")
I'm a huge fan of [PaaS, (Platform as a Service)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service), as much as I enjoy technology I no longer have the patience for managing the infrastructure aspect of solutions I build.  One such platform is [Azure's App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/), a fully managed service that enables you to deploy just about any application to the cloud and if you take the time to architect your solution well it's near trivial to scale your application to whatever needs the world presents you with.  Scale out? Scale up? your application can conform to whatever shape is necessary to keeping your business going.

![Cosmos DB](/images/posts/cosmos-db.png "Cosmos DB")
[Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/) is another incredibly powerful PaaS available in the Azure cloud. From the marketing literature it is a "Globally distributed, multi-model database service for any scale", but what does that mean?  What it means is that your global workforce can have instances of the key data they need to do their jobs put closer to their digital location to keep them working efficiently and also keeping changes with other regionally distributed.

![Microsoft Stream](/images/posts/stream-logo.png "Microsoft Stream")
And as I write this today it's Sunday and like many families mine typically goes to a church service on Sundays, and also like most families we are taking precautions such as avoiding large gatherings of people.  So does that mean that we can't attend service? actually no because our church like many others as well can record and stream a service virtually.  There are many technologies that help with this such as [Microsoft Stream](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-stream), and whereas the church streaming may have been used sparingly in the past it is getting a lot more use this weekend.  And is the service overwhelmed? is the service struggling to keep up with the new demand? nope the backend that supports it has seamlessly scaled to accommodate.  

As incredible as these handful of example there are some jobs that are simply impractical to do virtually. If you are a physical therapist that needs to work with patients to help them recover from a major surgery we aren't quite at the level of tech required to accommodate that.  That being said [holographic doctors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doctor_%28Star_Trek:_Voyager%29) may not be at our disposal yet but there are real technologies such as the [Hololens 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HoloLens_2) that get us ever closer.  Augmented reality is far from mainstream but it is another exciting branch of technology that can be used to help keep us connected during a time when we are avoiding unnecessary contact by making less of the contact necessary.

![MS Teams](/images/posts/microsoft-teams-logo.png "MS Teams")
One of my favorite collaboration platforms for the workplace is Microsoft Teams.  Obviously hosted w/in Microsoft's Azure cloud I've been very happy with the stability of Microsoft Teams for the last few years.  It may not be perfect (nothing ever is) but I really need to think hard about when is the last time I had an issue with Teams, and most (if not all) of those have been resolved with a restart of the app because I was between releases for some reason.  And a very timely call-out Microsoft is offering [Teams for free](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3530374/microsofts-solution-for-covid-19-is-a-free-teams-subscription-for-six-months.html) for 6 months for customers to help deal with the unexpected virtual working demands if their digital transformation journey hadn't quite gotten them there yet.  Personally I have to say that MS Teams is one of the tools that makes me the most confident that we will get through this situation because a lot of what I do professionally can be done via Teams and obviously not everyone can do that I believe that with a little creative thinking we can use this and similar technologies to proceed as much "business as usual" as we can during this trying time.


~~Bottom line, I'm excited to see how technology has enabled so many of us to adapt to the crazy situation that we find ourselves in. We have so many tools and processes at our disposal in this day and age thanks to technology that I believe will enable us to endure this trying time.  Last year there was a large push in tech consulting called [Digital Transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation), which IMO is fancy speak for using technology to digitally transform the way you do business.  And this is not even limited to "business" use cases, my brother and his wife are waiting for the arrival of their first child (I know great timing right!)and obviously you are careful about over exposing an infant in general but now it's even more of a concern.  So what are you to do when Grandparents, Aunts/Uncles, etc. want to meet the new addition to the family but need to be kept safe? Technology comes to the rescue in the form of [Skype](https://www.skype.com), [Facetime](https://www.apple.com/ios/facetime), and countless others so even if we can't hold the new little one we can still virtually meet him and experience his first days. As the situation progresses you can rest assured that digital technology will play a key role in helping us get through this.~~

In your situation how successful were you able to go virtual to cope with this unprecedented situation? Did it affect you at all? What shortcomings did you run into? How can we as a society be better ready for the next epidemic(because as we all know being overly prepared for anything is a sure fire way of ensuring that we never get to testing out how prepared we are).
