Title: Leadership - Remember To Celebrate & Understand Success
Lead: We all sometimes need a reminder to bring the same level of investigation to our successes as we do to our failures. It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of a job well done and move on to the next challenge. But if we don't take a step back and really look at why things went right, we miss an opportunity to repeat that success. We're used to dissecting failures for lessons learned, but how often do we pause to analyze what made our wins possible?

## Celebrating Success with the Same Energy as Failure

In the fast-paced world of consulting and tech, there's always another project on the horizon, another deadline to meet and some go really well and others... not so much. We've all been through post-mortems-those deep dives after a disastrous go-live or a project that's gone sideways. A company suffers a catastrophic failure, and leadership calls for an immediate stop to operations to figure out *what went wrong* and ensure it never happens again. This is a normal and an **incredibly important** activity anytime something goes wrong.

But let me ask you this: When was the last time your company paused to analyze success with that same level of intensity?

This [Instagram reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6Z6VzqPK5v) caught my eye and thought it was an interesting reminder worth sharing. The clip talks about involved a company that experienced a major fire. Unsurprisingly after getting the fire put out they chose to shut down for 24 hours, with the entire company focusing on how to *prevent it from ever happening again*. I don't deal with many buildings burning down thankfully, but I have been involved in what I've always call the "post-mortems". In consulting, a major failure can be the difference between maintaining a valuable client relationship or having them cancel the contract entirely. That pressure drives us to analyze every angle of failure, ensuring we don't lose trust or future business.

Hopefully not often but most of us have been there after the huge project that was supposed to keep a team busy for years was canceled, or a product launch over the weekend turned into an absolute nightmare. Leadership wants a detailed breakdown of how things went wrong and what steps will be taken to ensure the disaster doesn't repeat.

### But where's that same energy for success?

Your team just executed the smoothest go-live in the firm's history. You just secured the largest and most ambitious contract the company has ever seen, and not only delivered on it, but the client is already coming back for more. Sure, there's a happy hour to celebrate-and don't get me wrong, those are great and very appreciated! However, this is a good reminder that we need to go beyond celebrations to make sure we can *recreate* those wins. We all know it's important, but it's easy to overlook the value of reflecting on success in the same way we reflect on failures.

Does this concept sound familiar? Maybe you've heard of it in Agile? Ever heard of a "Retrospective"?

In Agile, teams often hold retrospectives at the end of a sprint, a moment to pause, reflect, and ask: "What went well? What didn't?" It's a crucial tool for continuous improvement. But what if we took that same mindset and applied it to our major successes as well? Imagine if, after every significant win, we paused to reflect: What made this project run so smoothly? Why did this client engagement exceed expectations? Was it the team's composition? A new framework or pattern that clicked into place? Or maybe a new approach that was different from the past?

If we don't stop to identify those factors, we lose the chance to repeat them. Success isn't just about the outcome-it's about understanding the process that led to it, so we can do it again.
- What was unique this time around?
- What decisions, people, or strategies made the difference?
- How can we ensure we continue to build on this foundation?

In consulting, we spend so much time fixing mistakes and ensuring they don't happen again. But shouldn't we spend at least as much time making sure our successes aren't just happy accidents?

**What about your team's successes?**  
- When was the last time you dug into a successful project as deeply as a failure?
- How does your team celebrate wins, and do you think that's enough to ensure future success?
- And most importantly how did that affect the team? Was everyone excited to understand and try to replicate the success?
