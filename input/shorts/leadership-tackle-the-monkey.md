Title: Leadership - Tackle the Monkey First
Lead: In the custom development and solutions consulting world, it's tempting to focus on easy wins that impress stakeholders. But tackling core challenges—like technical debt or complex integrations—early on is crucial for long-term success. In this post, I explore the common trap of prioritizing the "pedestal" over the "monkey" and offer strategies to balance visible progress with resolving project risks. Read on to learn how addressing both ensures smoother execution and builds trust with stakeholders.

## Leadership - Tackle the Monkey First: A Lesson from Custom Development and Solutions Consulting

This [YouTube short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Z9_a2Md0bDo) that was recently shared with me (thanks [Frank](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fsikorski/)!) highlighting a common pitfall in custom development and solutions consulting: prioritizing the "pedestal" (easy wins) over tackling the tough "monkey" (core challenges). While it's tempting to focus on delivering flashy features to stakeholders, ignoring key risks like technical debt or ambiguous requirements can derail a project down the line.

Ignoring these risks can cause major issues later. For example, maybe there's a complex integration that hasn't been tested, a performance bottleneck that could cripple scalability, or a client expectation that's unclear and could lead to rework. These are the "monkeys" that need to be dealt with head-on for the project to truly succeed.

However, simply focusing on the monkey isn't always realistic either. Stakeholders need to see progress, and businesses need tangible value for their investments. The challenge is balancing both: tackle the foundational problems early while still providing visible progress to keep stakeholders engaged and the project moving forward. Maybe you train the monkey in parallel or break down the challenge into manageable tasks while delivering incremental wins.

## What It Means for Us as Developers / Consultants

Instead of choosing between quick wins and core challenges, seek balance. Address the risky challenges early, but also provide visible progress to keep business stakeholders satisfied. In custom development, this approach builds long-term trust while mitigating risks for smoother project execution.
